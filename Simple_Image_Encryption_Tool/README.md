# 🔐 LK Image Encryptor

Welcome to **LK Image Encryptor** – a simple, beginner-friendly image encryption and decryption tool developed as part of my internship at **ProDigy Infotech**.

This tool performs basic **pixel manipulation** (color inversion) to encrypt and decrypt image files using Python.

## 🧑‍💻 Developed By

**LK**  
Intern at **ProDigy Infotech**  
Project: *Image Encryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation*

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Encrypt images using pixel value transformation  
✅ Decrypt encrypted images back to original  
✅ GUI with **Tkinter**  
✅ Supports common formats like JPG and PNG  
✅ Beginner-friendly Python codebase  
✅ Ready for GitHub deployment

## 🧠 How It Works

The encryption is based on **pixel inversion**:

Each pixel's RGB value is transformed using:

```

Encrypted: (R, G, B) → (255 - R, 255 - G, 255 - B)

````

Decrypting the image uses the **same function**, since inverting twice returns the original image.

This is a **basic symmetric encryption** idea for educational purposes.

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure Python is installed (v3.6+). Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### `requirements.txt` contains:

```
Pillow
tk
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🔧 Run the GUI version:

```bash
python main.py
```

* Click **Browse** to select an image
* Click **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**
* Choose where to save the output

### 💻 Use in Python (Command Line):

```python
from encryptor import encrypt_image, decrypt_image

encrypt_image("input.jpg", "encrypted.png")
decrypt_image("encrypted.png", "decrypted.png")
```

---

## 📸 Sample Input/Output

> 💡 Add your own test images or examples

* `sample.jpg` → `encrypted.png` → `decrypted.png`

---

## 🛠️ To Do (Optional Improvements)

* Add image password locking
* Use stronger encryption (AES or XOR)
* Add drag-and-drop support in GUI
* Allow batch image encryption
